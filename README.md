### Pierre's Bakery
Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:

There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

The application will return the total cost of the order.

Pierre offers the following deals:

Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free (every 3rd loaf of bread is free.). A single loaf costs $5, two loaves costs $10, and three loaves cost $10.
Pastry: Buy 1 for $2 or 3 for $5. Four pastries costs $7, five pastries costs $9, and six pastries costs $10.
All functionality for the models should be tested.

* _clone or download responsitory to your local_
* _cd into Bakery.Tests and run dotnet restore and dotnet test to run/add to tests_
